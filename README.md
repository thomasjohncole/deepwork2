# Deep Work - The application

This is a side project I've been working on for a while. After I read the book Deep Work, by Cal Newport, I started tracking my coding study/work hours in a simple text file. As the file got bigger, I wanted to see things like total hours for a month, or cumulative totals, without having to to the math every time, so I created this app to track my deep work time. It is a work in progress.
